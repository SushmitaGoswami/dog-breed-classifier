# dog-breed-classifier
## Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! Created a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
